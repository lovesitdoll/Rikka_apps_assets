# Enhance module

## Features

* Guarantee _Storage Redirect_ starts early than normal apps during boot stage
* Guarantee redirected app\'s logic runs later than redirect
* Monitor file access in public storage (only monitors _open_ call in _libc_ from app processes)

_Since this solution needs to replace system files, we only provide Magisk modules for now._

## Precautions

* **Must to cooperate with _Storage Redirect_ 0.18.0+**
* Try to disable (delete) it if you have any problem
* If there is a problem, it is helpful for developers to provide the log since booting
* For devices that have encryption enabled and the decryption process is performed after the boot is completed (usually due to enable accessibility apps), if decryption (unlocking for the first time) is too late, it may cause the redirected accessibility apps or IME apps (and apps support Direct boot) unable to use. If you need to use the input method to unlock, do not enable redirect for this input method.

## Install

### Install with Magisk (recommended)

> The Magisk module approach uses [Magisk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445) to replace system files without modifying real `/system`

From v13, enhance module is a module of [Riru](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru), install Riru is required.

> Riru is open-source thing to inject app process by a replace system file. Riru module will able to exectue its own code in app process with Riru.

0. **IMPORTANT: Delete all old module before v13**
1. Download Riru - Core
2. Download Riru - Storage Redirect
3. Install in _Magisk Manager_

## Download

_Before installation, **please make sure to confirm that you have learned how to remove the module when system can't start**, otherwise, you will not be able to enter the system if your system is not compatible with it_

**Please be sure to read the instructions, otherwise, developers will blame you if you report any of the conditions that already mentioned**

## How to check if it works

* During the boot process, check if there is log like `StorageRedirectInject: replaced com.android.internal.os.Zygote#nativeForkAndSpecialize` (you must connect your device to PC and use adb logcat to check this log, because it will be triggered during the very early progress of booting)
* When opening any app, check if there is log like  `StorageRedirectInject: nativeForkAndSpecialize called, uid=` (use anything that can read log is ok)
